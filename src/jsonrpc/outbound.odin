// Outbound: the optional dedicated writer thread for a Conn. When
// installed, every frame crosses the wire from this one thread, fed by a
// bounded queue — a peer that stops reading (a hung language server with
// a full stdin pipe) then blocks exactly one thread instead of every
// sender: posts fail once the queue is full past their deadline, so no
// caller-side lock ever queues behind a pipe write. A failed write marks
// the connection broken (callers observe a closed conn); teardown unwedges
// the thread because the owner kills the peer process first (the kill
// turns the blocked write into EPIPE), and conn_destroy joins it.
